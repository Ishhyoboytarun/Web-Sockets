# Web Sockets Example in Go

This is a basic example of implementing WebSockets in a Go application.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from the official website: [https://golang.org/](https://golang.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ishhyoboytarun/Web-Sockets.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd Web-Sockets
```

3. Build the application:

```bash
go build
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
./Web-Sockets
```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can connect to the WebSocket endpoint using a WebSocket client or a browser.

### Connecting to the WebSocket

Use the following URL to connect to the WebSocket endpoint:

```
ws://localhost:8080/ws
```

### Sending and Receiving Messages

Once connected, you can send and receive messages to and from the WebSocket.

#### Sending a Message

To send a message to the WebSocket, use the WebSocket client's send function or the browser's WebSocket API.

Example using JavaScript in a browser:

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/ws');

// Send a message
socket.send('Hello, WebSocket!');
```

#### Receiving Messages

To receive messages from the WebSocket, you need to handle the `onmessage` event of the WebSocket client or the browser's WebSocket API.

Example using JavaScript in a browser:

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/ws');

// Receive messages
socket.onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log('Received message:', event.data);
};
```

## Customization

You can customize the WebSocket behavior by modifying the Go code in `main.go`. Feel free to explore and experiment with different features and functionalities.
